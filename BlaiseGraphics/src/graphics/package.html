        The <code>graphics</code> library is for managing and drawing a lot of shapes
        on a <code>Graphics2d</code> canvas, and providing some <i>light</i> interactivity
        (particularly mouse event handling).
      </p>
      <h1>Design</h1>
      <p>
          <code>ShapeComponent</code> is the top-level swing component, and works primarily
          with two classes: a <code>ShapeCache</code> and a <code>ShapeCacheRenderer</code>.
          As might be expected, the first is responsible for storing the shapes and the
          second for drawing the shapes. However, most of the stylistic information for
          the shapes is stored within the cache itself; the renderer is available if this
          default styling (or the default draw order of shapes specified by the cache) needs
          to be overridden in some way.
      </p>
      <p>
          Shapes within the <code>ShapeCache</code> are stored as a <code>ShapeEntry</code>, which
          is comprised of (i) the shape itself, (ii) a renderer for that shape, (iii) a parent for
          that shape, and (iv) visibility status (<code>ShapeVisibility</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
          The <code>ShapeCache</code> maintains the shapes that are to be drawn, including both
          the shapes themselves and the order in which they are drawn. The cache also listens to
          mouse events from the <code>ShapeComponent</code>, which it passes along as a
          <code>ShapeMouseEvent</code> to the top-most <code>ShapeEntry</code> (in terms of draw
          order) whose parent is a <code>ShapeMouseListener</code>.
