 * I shamelessly titled this package <i>blaise</i> in reference to the
 *   mathematician Blaise Pascal and as a pun on "blaze". Perhaps I am blazing
 *   a trail? or perhaps just headstrong enough to think this collection of
 *   code deserves a fun name ala "swing".<br><br>
 *
 * Anyway, the purpose is to implement mathematical display of plots and so on,
 *   with a strong emphasis on interactivity. The main file at this point is
 *   PlotPanel2D.java, which implements a panel suitable for plotting functions,
 *   with support for axes, grids, tick marks, and so on. Its pretty cool!
