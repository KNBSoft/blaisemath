= Required Downloads =

== Recommended IDE ==

This project is being developed within Netbeans (http://www.netbeans.org). We recommended downloading the latest version, and installing any updates, before downloading any of the source code for the projects here.

== Required External Packages ==

*Apache Commons Math* (_available at http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_math.cgi _) is an open-source library of useful mathematical classes and algorithms. To install the library, download and extract the binary [http://datadispensary.com/apache/commons/math/binaries/commons-math-2.0.zip .zip] file at the above link. You'll then need to add the `.jar` file to the projects which require it (currently `blaisemath`, `blaiseparser`, and `blaisecore`). We recommend adding the library to the Netbeans Library Manger. To do this, select the menu option `Tools>>Libraries`, click `New Library...`, and add the `.jar` files in the download for `Classpath` (required), `Sources` (optional), and `Documentation` (optional).

*Firestarter* (_available at http://javafirestorm.googlecode.com _) is an open-source project that implements, among other things, property tables and various other layout functionality used in _Blaise_. You will either need to download the `.zip` file from the linked website to get the `.jar` file for the project, or checkout the project from the website.

== Projects to Checkout ==

To use the full functionality of _Blaise_, you will need to checkout all of the following packages from the repository hosted on this project site:

  * BlaiseMath: mathematical functionality, building on the Apache Commons library
  * BlaiseParser: basic mathematical parsing
  * BlaiseCore: the core library, implementing the plot libraries and plotting architecture
