#summary Description of generic plottable objects defined for all visometries
#labels Module-Blaise,Component-Plottable

These plottables are generic typed classes in the revised blaisecore package. Annotations are as follows:

(A) indicates an AnimatingPlottable
(C) indicates a Constrains2D
(D) indicates a DynamicPlottable

VInvisiblePoint (D)
single point that may be moved around the visometry, but is not drawn
VComputedPath (D)
stores a path which is computed by subclasses
Single points:
VPoint (D)
extends VInvisiblePoint; single point that may be moved around the visometry
VLabel (D)
extends VInvisiblePoint; label at a local coordinate that may be moved around the visometry
Two points:

VLine (D)
line or vector between two points… multiple views of the line (e.g. as a vector, line, or segment) are supported via the style classes
VRectangle (D)
rectangle with draggable corners
More points:

VPointSet (D)
collection of points that may be individually manipulated
VPath
collection of points displayed as a path
VParticleField
collection of points (or small trails) displayed individually, and moving about based upon abstract methods
VComputedPointPath (D)
extends VPoint; stores a point which may be moved around freely, together with a path (that depends on the point)… the path is computed by subclasses
