#summary Description of generic plottable objects defined for all visometries
#labels Module-Blaise,Component-Plottable

These plottables are generic typed classes in the `blaisecore` package. Annotations are as follows:

  * (A) indicates an `AnimatingPlottable`
  * (D) indicates a `DynamicPlottable`

=Concrete Plottables=

*Single-Coordinate Plottables*

  * `VInvisiblePoint` (D) is a single point that may be moved around the visometry, but is not drawn
  * `VPoint` (D) extends `VInvisiblePoint`; single point that may be moved around the visometry
  * `VLabel` (D) extends `VInvisiblePoint`; label at a local coordinate that may be moved around the visometry
  * `VClock` (A,D) extends `VInvisiblePoint`; draws a clock at an arbitrary position using the `ClockStyle` primitive style; position is tied to the underlying coordinate

*Multi-Coordinate Plottables*
  * `VPointSet` (D) is a collection of points that may be individually manipulated
  * `VPath` is a collection of points displayed as a path; coordinates may be set directly, but not manipulated

*Geometric Shapes*

  * `VLine` (D) line or vector between two pointsâ€¦ multiple views of the line (e.g. as a vector, line, or segment) are supported via the style classes
  * `VRectangle` (D) rectangle with draggable corners
  * `VPolygon` (D) extends `VPointSet`; displayed as a filled in shape rather than a collection of points

=Abstract Plottables=

*Paths*
  * `VComputedPath` (D) has basic functionality for drawing a path, but requires the path to first be created by a subclass
  * `VComputedPointPath` (D) extends `VPoint`; stores a point which may be moved around freely; subclass is responsible for recomputing the path whenever the point is moved; structurally this is very similar to `VComputedPath` and they may possibly be merged in the future

*Collections*

  * `VPrimitiveMappingPlottable` draws a collection of primitive elements at various points specified by an underlying `SampleCoordinateSetGenerator` (see PrimitiveMappingPlottable)
  * `VParticleField` (A) draws a collection of points (or small trails) displayed individually, and moving about based upon abstract methods
