#summary Description of generic plottable objects defined for all visometries
#labels Module-Blaise,Component-Plottable

These plottables are generic typed classes in the revised blaisecore package. Annotations are as follows:

  * (A) indicates an `AnimatingPlottable`
  * (D) indicates a `DynamicPlottable`

=Adjustable Points and Variations=

  * `VInvisiblePoint` (D) is a single point that may be moved around the visometry, but is not drawn
  * `VPoint` (D) extends `VInvisiblePoint`; single point that may be moved around the visometry
  * `VLabel` (D) extends `VInvisiblePoint`; label at a local coordinate that may be moved around the visometry

=Rigid Geometric Shapes=

  * `VLine` (D) line or vector between two points… multiple views of the line (e.g. as a vector, line, or segment) are supported via the style classes
  * `VRectangle` (D) rectangle with draggable corners

=Generic Multipoint Shapes=

  * `VPointSet` (D) collection of points that may be individually manipulated
  * `VPolygon` (D) extends `VPointSet`; displayed as a filled in shape rather than a collection of points

  * `VPath` collection of points displayed as a path
  * `VComputedPath` (D) stores a path which is computed by subclasses
  * `VComputedPointPath` (D) extends VPoint; stores a point which may be moved around freely, together with a path (that depends on the point)… the path is computed by subclasses

=Advanced Plottables=

  * `VPrimitiveMappingPlottable`: draws collection of primitive elements at various points specified by an underlying `SampleSetGenerator` (see PrimitiveMappingPlottable)
  * `VParticleField` collection of points (or small trails) displayed individually, and moving about based upon abstract methods
