#summary Description of generic plottable objects defined for all visometries
#labels Module-Blaise,Component-Plottable
#sidebar TableOfContents

These plottables are generic typed classes in the `blaisecore` package. Annotations are as follows:
  * (A) indicates an `AnimatingPlottable`
  * (D) indicates a `DynamicPlottable`

= Concrete Plottables =

|| *Name of Class* || *Base Class(es)* || *Annotations* || *Description* ||
|| `VClock` || `VInvisiblePoint` || (A,D) || draws a clock at an arbitrary position using the `ClockStyle` primitive style; position is tied to the underlying coordinate ||
|| `VLabel` || `VInvisiblePoint` || (D) || label at a local coordinate that may be moved around the visometry ||
|| `VInvisiblePoint` || || (D) || single point that may be moved around, but is not drawn ||
|| `VLine` || || (D) || line or vector between two pointsâ€¦ multiple views of the line (e.g. as a vector, line, or segment) are supported via the style classes ||
|| `VPath` || || || a collection of points displayed as a path; coordinates may be set directly, but not manipulated ||
|| `VPolygon` || `VPointSet` || (D) || displayed as a filled in shape rather than a collection of points ||
|| `VPoint` || `VInvisiblePoint` || (D) || single point that may be moved around the visometry ||
|| `VPointSet` || || (D) || a collection of points that may be individually manipulated ||
|| `VRectangle` || || (D) || rectangle with draggable corners and sides ||

= Abstract Plottables =

|| *Name of Class* || *Base Class(es)* || *Annotations* || *Description* ||
|| `VComputedPath` || || (D) || basic functionality for drawing a path, but requires the path to first be created by a subclass ||
|| `VComputedPointPath` || `VPoint` || (D) || stores a point which may be moved around freely; subclass is responsible for recomputing the path whenever the point is moved; structurally this is very similar to `VComputedPath` and they may possibly be merged in the future ||
|| `VParticleField` || || (A) || draws a collection of points (or small trails) displayed individually, and moving about based upon abstract methods ||
|| `VPrimitiveMappingPlottable` || || || draws a collection of primitive elements at various points specified by an underlying `SampleCoordinateSetGenerator` (see PrimitiveMappingPlottable) ||
