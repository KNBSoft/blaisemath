#summary Architecture & coding conventions for BlaiseGraphics

= Dependencies =
BlaiseGraphics uses JDK 1.6+, and depends on the [https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/ guava library] and jsr305 for building.

= Packages =
 * `org.blaise.graphics` - graphics object and scene tree, depends on style and utility packages
 * `org.blaise.style` - self-contained style classes, uses the utility library
 * `org.blaise.util` - self-contained utility library

= Style Library =
== Style Classes ==
The primary classes in the style library are the style classes:
 * `ShapeStyle` (I)
  * `BasicShapeStyle`
 * `PathStyle` (I) (extends `ShapeStyle`)
  * `BasicPathStyle`
   * `ArrowPathStyle`
   * `BezierPathStyle`
   * `DecoratorPathStyle`
 * `StringStyle` (I)
  * `BasicStringStyle`
   * `WrappingStringStyle`
 * `PointStyle` (I)
  * `PointStyleSupport`
   * `BasicPointStyle`
    * `InfinitePointStyle`
   * `DecoratorPointStyle`
  * `LabeledPointStyle`

These classes obey the following conventions:
 * _bean pattern_ (no-argument constructor, with get/set property methods)
 * property names are aligned where possible with SVG attribute names
 * toString() method implemented
 * clone() method implemented
 * _builder pattern_ for quickly setting properties
 * `@Nullable` annotations indicating whether null properties are permitted

Additionally, the names follow the conventions:
 * "Basic" style classes are simple objects with necessary style attributes.
 * "Decorator" style classes defer some of their style attributes to an underlying class, possibly in an indirect way (e.g. some attributes may be multiplicative).
 * "Support" style classes are generally abstract, partial implementations of style classes.

== Context Classes ==
Context classes are:
 * `StyleContext` (I)
  * `DefaultStyleContext`
  * `DelegatingStyleContext`
These are essentially factory classes providing instances of the four main style types.

== `ObjectStyler` ==
The `ObjectStyler` class provides several _delegate_ functions used to generate styles for an object of arbitrary type, specifically for _labels_, _label style_, _object style_, and _tooltip_.

== Markers ==
Markers are objects used to draw a shape at a given location and orientation.
 * `Marker` - generates shapes at a given point
 * `MarkerLibrary` - contains several instances of `Marker`

== `VisibilityHint` ==
`VisibilityHint` is a render hint that is disjoint from styles and is universal, similar to a _CSS class_. It may be used, e.g. to highlight a collection of shapes. Styles are responsible for how they handle different hints.

== Factory and utility methods ==
The `Styles` class is a factory class providing simple methods for creating basic style objects. The `StyleUtils` provides some basic color manipulation capability, as well as support for modifying colors based on `VisibilityHint`s.
