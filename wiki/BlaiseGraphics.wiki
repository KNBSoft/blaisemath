`BlaiseGraphics` is a lightweight library used to render and interact with collections of 2d shapes.

=Usage=
The simplest way to use the library is to draw stylized shapes on a `Graphics2D` object. Doing this is a simple matter of creating a `GraphicComponent` and adding a number of `Graphic` objects to that component.
