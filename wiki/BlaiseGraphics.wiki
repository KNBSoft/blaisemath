`BlaiseGraphics` is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph scene graph] library, used to render and interact with collections of 2d shapes on a Java graphics canvas.

=Usage=
The simplest way to use the library is to draw stylized shapes on a `Graphics2D` object. Doing this is a simple matter of creating a `GraphicComponent` and adding a number of `Graphic` objects to that component.
