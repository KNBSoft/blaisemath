`BlaiseGraphics` is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph scene graph] library, used to render and interact with collections of 2d shapes on a Java graphics canvas.

=Usage=
The simplest way to use the library is to draw stylized shapes on a `Graphics2D` object. Doing this is a simple matter of creating a `GraphicComponent` and adding a number of `Graphic` objects to that component.

_EXAMPLES TO BE ADDED LATER_

=Graphic=
`Graphic` is the basic building block of the library, representing an object that can be drawn on a `Graphics2D` canvas. Graphics have the following attributes & methods:
 * Parent object (a `GraphicComposite`)
 * A draw method
 * Visibility hints to customize how the object is drawn
 * Methods to test whether the graphic contains a given point, or intersects a given rectangle
 * Flag indicating whether the graphic can be selected
 * Tooltip (optional)
 * Customized context menu (optional), in the form of one or more `ContextMenuInitializer`s
 * Support for adding `MouseListener`s and `MouseMotionListener`s


=Design=

==Design Requirements==
 * Render a tree of Graphics2D shapes (including text)
 * Separate style customization from shapes
 * Display tooltips for shapes as necessary
 * Feed mouse events to shapes' registered objects as necessary
 * Forward changes from shapes to get a redraw
 * Display mouseover and other "highlight" effects
