A `PrimitiveStyle` is a class that is responsible for the final display of a visual object. In a way, this is merely an extension of the concepts of _fill_ and _stroke_ already present in Java. The point is to consolidate and reuse common drawing routines.

Under this architecture, figures are drawn by first creating one or more `GraphicsPrimitive` objects that will be displayed, such as paths, segments, points, etc., and then using the `PrimitiveStyle` classes associated with these to select the final way things look when drawn.
