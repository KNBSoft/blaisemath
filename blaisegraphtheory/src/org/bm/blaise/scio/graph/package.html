          This package contains the primary classes for graphs, including interfaces
          and default implementations. The two most important implementations are
          <code>SparseGraph</code>, where the edges are encoded using lists, and <code>MatrixGraph</code>,
          where the edges are encoded using arrays.
      </p>
      <p>
          A few additional graph types
          (such as those with weighted nodes or edges) are also supported with interfaces
          and implementations that wrap an existing graph.

          The <code>Graphs</code> class provides several utility methods for generating
          specific types of graphs, including random graphs, as well as performing some
          standard computations on graphs, such as finding neighborhoods and shortest
          path lengths.
