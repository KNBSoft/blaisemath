          This package contains special-purpose utility methods for computing metrics
          associated with graphs, such as centrality metrics.

          Most metrics are subclassed from <code>NodeMetric</code> and <code>NodeSubsetMetric</code>,
          which provide metrics for 1 node or any number of nodes, respectively.
