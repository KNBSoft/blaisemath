    Description: This file is a hypothetical XML template for a "BlaisePage".
-->


<!-- nav option describes whether to link multiple pages together with nav buttons -->
<blaisepage nav="true" name="page1">
    <title>
        This is the title.
    </title>
    <description>
        This is the description of the author, purpose of the applet, etc.
    </description>
    <body>
        <p>
            This is the main "<b>body</b>" area, where I'll be putting the main text
            that goes along with the applet. It might be a description of the math,
            or instructions about the applet, or possibly something else.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would also like to put in function definitions, e.g.
            <function plot="plot1">f(x)=sin(x)</function>, that can be automatically
            plotted or "moused over" or "linked", perhaps by rendering
            inline icons next to the function or when the function is moused over.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would also like to include hyperlinks, both to <blaiseref="page2">other
            pages</blaiseref> and to <a href="http://blaisemath.googlecode.com/">websites</a>.
            The intention is to make it easy to convert to and from html code, so I would
            like to borrow as much as possible from that.
        </p>
